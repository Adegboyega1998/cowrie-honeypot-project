# Cowrie SSH Honeypot Project

This project simulates an SSH server using the Cowrie honeypot to observe, log, and analyze unauthorized access attempts. It is a great blue-team learning exercise to understand attacker behavior in a controlled lab environment.

## Technologies Used

- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (VirtualBox)
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- Cowrie Honeypot
- SSH over port 2222
- Python3 and virtual environments

## Objective

Deploy Cowrie, simulate SSH attacks from Kali, and analyze the logs to understand attack patterns and behaviors.

## Setup Overview

- VirtualBox VM created and configured
- Cowrie deployed on Ubuntu Server
- Attacks simulated using SSH from Kali
- Activity logged and analyzed
